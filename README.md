Textual explanation:
    Out program has 4 buttons for simulating 4 different scenarios (two shockable rhythm, asystole and dead rhythm) For testing, 
    first turn on the device by clicking the power-On button, then make sure self-test is passed by ensuring the remaing battery
    is above 15 and electrode is connected (clicks the electrode connected check box to connect)  After self test is passed, click
    one of 4 simulation buttons to starting the operation. During the operation, the 5 image instructions illuminate one-by-one every
    2 seconds, while the textual message is printed on the console simultaneously. The program also supports the simulation of pad
    placement, battery depletion, changing patient's age and patient status record. After performing the CPR, program generates a random 
    value to determine whether patient gets healthy, dies or remain unhealthy, it is possible that the patient who has shockable rhythm
    turns out to have asystole rhythm after receiving the CPR. The max analysis-CPR loop is 3, which means if patient does not get healthy
    after cpr period 3 times, they will die.
